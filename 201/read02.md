 the script is made up of a series of statements each statement is like a step in a recipe, the scripts contain very precise instructions, for example, we specify that a value must be rememberedbefore creating a calculation using that value,variables are used to temporarily store pieces ofinformation used in the script ,Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information,JavaScriptdistinguishes between numbers (0-9),strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false),expressions evaluate into a single value,expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
